# Azure Container Registry

This module is just a thin wrapper around the `azurerm_container_registry` resource to enforce naming standards and
security policies (no admin user enabled). It can also assign roles for pulling and pushing images.

## Requirements

- Minimum **Contributor** access to create registry
- **Owner** required when using *roles* variable

## Usage

Example of a simple deployment

```terraform
module "simple" {
  source  = "avinor/container-registry/azurerm"
  version = "1.1.0"

  name                = "acr"
  resource_group_name = "simpleacr-rg"
  location            = "westeurope"

  roles = [
    {
      object_id = "0000-0000-0000"
      role      = "AcrPull"
    },
  ]
}
```

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics settings can be sent to either storage account, event hub or Log Analytics workspace. The variable
diagnostics.destination is the id of receiver, ie. storage account id, event namespace authorization rule id or log
analytics resource id. Depending on what id is it will detect where to send. Unless using event namespace the
eventhub_name_log and eventhub_name_metric is not required, just set to null for storage account and log analytics
workspace.

Setting all in logs and metrics will send all possible diagnostics to destination. If not using all type name of
categories to send.

## Roles

Using `roles` input variable it is possible to assign any role to the container registry. It is primarily meant for
assigning Acr* roles though, pulling and pushing images.

## Docker Content Trust

[ACR support content trust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-content-trust)
on registries with Premium sku. This module will enable content trust when `content_trust` variable is set to true. Just
enabling is not enough though. For configuring content trust additional setup needs to be done after.

- Grant temporary role `AcrImageSigner` permission on registry to your user
- Run `az acr login --name <name>`. Run after assigning role to get correct token.
- Set `export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1`
- Build an image and push to new registry
    - It will ask for root and repository passphrase. Generate a new random strong passphrase
    - Make sure to write down these passphrases somewhere
- Backup private keys for content trust
    - Create
      archive: `umask 077; tar -zcvf docker_private_keys_backup.tar.gz -C $HOME/.docker/trust/private .; umask 022`
    - Store in a secure way
- Remove temporary role `AcrImageSigner` from registry

For using content trust in CI/CD process:

- Create a delegated key pair for signing in pipeline: `docker trust key generate pipeline`
- Find private key file in docker trust folder: `grep pipeline ~/.docker/trust/private/*`
- Add private key, delegated key passphrase and root passphrase as secrets in CI process
- Save the public key generated in repository or anywhere it is required when signing images

When using in pipeline make sure the private key is stored in `$HOME/.docker/trust/private` and define environment
variables `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST_REPOSITORY_PASSPHRASE` and `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST_ROOT_PASSPHRASE`. This allows pipeline
to sign and push images.

Before pushing a new signed image the repository always needs to be initialized first.
Run `docker trust signer add --key pipeline.pub pipeline <image_name>`, where pipeline.pub is the public key and
pipeline is name of delegated user created earlier.
